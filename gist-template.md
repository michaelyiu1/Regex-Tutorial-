# Regex Tutorial
This is a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does

## Summary

A regular expression (also called regex or regexp) is a way to describe a pattern. It is used to locate or validate specific strings or patterns of text in a sentence, document, or any other character input.

Regular expressions use both basic and special characters. Basic characters are standard letters, numbers, and general keyboard characters, while all other characters are considered special.

This article will introduce special characters and discuss using them in regex and extended regular expressions (ERE) with examples.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors have special meaning in regular expressions. They do not match any character. Instead, they match a position before or after characters:

 ^ – The caret anchor matches the beginning of the text.
 $ – The dollar anchor matches the end of the text.

 See the following example:

let str = 'JavaScript';
console.log(/^J/.test(str));

Output: true

Summary:
Use the ^ anchor to match the beginning of the text.
Use the $ anchor to match the end of the text.
Use the m flag to enable the multiline mode that instructs the ^ and $ anchors to match the beginning and end of the text as well as the beginning and end of the line.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.
